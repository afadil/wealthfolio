//! Currency conversion for the spending surfaces.

/// Converts `amount` from `from` into `to` at `as_of`.
///
/// Returns `None` only when the pair has no rate at all: the FX service already
/// resolves the nearest date, then falls back to the latest rate, before
/// failing.
///
/// Callers aggregating into a target currency must treat `None` as no
/// contribution. Substituting the unconverted amount mixes currencies into the
/// total — a missing EUR→JPY rate would add yen to a euro figure.
///
/// # Which date to pass
///
/// `as_of` is the caller's decision, and the crate deliberately runs two
/// conventions:
///
/// * `insight`, `analytics` and `budget` pass **one rate per report** — the
///   period's snapshot date, matching the net-worth convention. Period
///   comparisons then reflect spending rather than currency drift.
/// * `cash_activities` passes **each activity's own date**, because a
///   transaction list reports what a row actually cost at the time. This
///   matches how acquisitions are valued (`Lot::stored_fx_rate_to`, else the
///   acquisition-date rate).
///
/// The two therefore disagree by design, and a total on the transactions tab
/// need not equal the same span in Reports.
