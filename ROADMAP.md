Here is a draft of my vision to this project. Any ideas are welcome:

## Vision

To help individuals build their wealth by providing a safe, privacy-focused and easy-to-use tool to
track their investments and goals.

## Strategy

1. Build a polished application that focuses on the essentials
2. Underdo the competition by offering a simpler, more focused alternative
3. Fight feature creep and resist creating a bloated app
4. Avoid complexity at all costs
5. Provide clear insights on how your portfolio is performing against your goals

## What We Believe In

1. Your Privacy: Your money info stays on your computer. You retain complete control over your
   financial information..
2. Easy to Use: Anyone can track their investments with our simple design.
3. No Hidden Costs: Free or Pay once to support. Use forever—no surprise fees or subscriptions.
4. Lots of Features: Track many types of investments and use helpful tools.
5. Beautiful, Focused, and Boring App: We believe in crafting an app that's visually appealing yet
   doesn't distract from its core purpose.
