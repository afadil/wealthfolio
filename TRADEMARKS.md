# Wealthfolio Trademarks

"Wealthfolio" (word mark) and the Wealthfolio logos (the “Trademarks”) identify
the official Wealthfolio project.

Open source licenses grant copyright permissions. Trademarks are different: this
policy explains what you may and may not do with the Trademarks.

## Allowed without permission

You may, without prior written permission:

1. Refer to Wealthfolio in a descriptive way (“Wealthfolio-compatible”, “runs
   Wealthfolio”, “based on Wealthfolio”) when the reference is accurate and does
   not imply endorsement.
2. Use the Trademarks in articles, reviews, tutorials, screenshots, and
   documentation that discuss Wealthfolio.
3. Redistribute unmodified official Wealthfolio builds (binaries) and use the
   Trademarks to identify them as official.
4. Use the Trademarks to link to the official project (website/repo) in a way
   that clearly points to the official source.

## Not allowed without permission

You may not, without prior written permission:

1. Use the Trademarks in a product, service, company, or domain name (including
   app store listings) if it could imply you are the official project.
2. Use the Trademarks for modified versions, forks, or derivative distributions.
3. Use the Trademarks in a way that suggests sponsorship, affiliation,
   certification, or endorsement by the official project.
4. Use logos/wordmarks on a hosted offering (SaaS/managed service) in a way that
   suggests it is “Wealthfolio” rather than “a fork of Wealthfolio”.

## Forks and modified builds

Forks and modified builds must:

- Use a different name (not “Wealthfolio” or confusingly similar).
- Remove Wealthfolio logos and other brand assets.
- Avoid UI/marketing that implies the fork is official.
- You may say: “Forked from Wealthfolio (https://wealthfolio.app/)” or “Based on
  Wealthfolio”, prominently, with a disclaimer.

## Attribution

When referencing the Trademarks, include: “Wealthfolio is a trademark of Teymz
Inc.”
