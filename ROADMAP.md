# Wealthfolio Roadmap

## Vision

To help individuals build their wealth by providing a safe, privacy-focused and
easy-to-use tool to track their investments and goals.

## Strategy

1. Build a polished application that focuses on the essentials
2. Underdo the competition by offering a simpler, more focused alternative
3. Fight feature creep and resist creating a bloated app
4. Avoid complexity at all costs
5. Provide clear insights on how your portfolio is performing against your goals

## What We Believe In

1. **Your Privacy**: Your money info stays on your computer. You retain complete
   control over your financial information.
2. **Easy to Use**: Anyone can track their investments with our simple design.
3. **No Lock-in**: Free or pay once to support. Wealthfolio Connect as optional
   paid subscription to sync broker data and devices.
4. **Extensible**: Through the addons system and catalog, users can easily
   enhance functionality.
5. **Beautiful and Focused**: We believe in crafting an app that's visually
   appealing yet doesn't distract from its core purpose.
