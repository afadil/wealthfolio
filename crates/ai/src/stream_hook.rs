//! Stream-level guard rails for the agentic loop.
//!
//! Implements rig's `StreamingPromptHook` to prevent three failure modes we see
//! with small open-source models (qwen, ministral, etc.):
//!
//! 1. **Tool-call storms** — the model re-emits the same tool call dozens of
//!    times per turn. Detected via a per-`(tool, args)` counter in
//!    [`WealthfolioStreamHook::on_tool_call`]. Repeated calls are short-circuited
//!    with `ToolCallHookAction::Skip { reason }` — which rig feeds back to the
//!    model as the tool result, so the model sees the cached data it already
//!    received and a nudge to stop re-calling.
//!
//! 2. **Global runaway** — total tool calls across a turn can still blow up even
//!    with dedup. Hard cap via `ToolCallHookAction::Terminate` when over
//!    [`MAX_TOTAL_TOOL_CALLS`].
//!
//! 3. **Token-level repetition loops** — the model streams
//!    `"get_performance, get_performance, ..."` indefinitely without ever
//!    emitting a well-formed tool call (qwen thinking mode). Detected in
//!    [`WealthfolioStreamHook::on_text_delta`] by looking for a short suffix
//!    that already appears many times in the trailing buffer, or by the
//!    stream exceeding [`MAX_STREAM_CHARS`].
//!
//! The hook is `Clone` per rig's trait bound; cheap because state is behind
//! an `Arc<Mutex<_>>`.
