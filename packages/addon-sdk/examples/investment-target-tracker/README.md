# Investment Target Tracker Addon

A Wealthfolio addon that helps you visualize your investment progress towards target amounts using a calendar-style representation.

## Features

- **Visual Progress Tracking**: See your investment progress with a calendar grid where each dot represents a milestone
- **Configurable Targets**: Set your investment target amount and step size per dot
- **Real-time Portfolio Integration**: Automatically loads your current portfolio value using the Wealthfolio API
- **Interactive Milestones**: Click on dots to see the target amount for each milestone
- **Progress Metrics**: View current amount, target, progress percentage, and remaining amount

## How It Works

1. **Set Your Target**: Configure your investment target amount (default: $100,000)
2. **Choose Step Size**: Set how much each dot represents (default: $10,000)
3. **View Progress**: The calendar shows:
   - âœ… Green dots for completed milestones
   - ðŸŸ¡ Partially filled dot for current progress
   - âšª Empty dots for future milestones

## Installation

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

2. Package the addon:
   ```bash
   pnpm package
   ```

3. Install in Wealthfolio through the addon settings page

## Screenshot

The addon displays a calendar grid similar to GitHub's contribution calendar, but for investment milestones:

```
ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µâšªâšªâšª
ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢âšªâšªâšªâšª
âšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšªâšª
```

Where:
- ðŸŸ¢ = Completed milestone
- ðŸ”µ = Partially completed current milestone  
- âšª = Future milestone
