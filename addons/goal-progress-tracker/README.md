# Goal Progress Tracker Addon

A Wealthfolio addon that helps you visualize your investment progress towards financial goals using an interactive calendar-style representation.

## Features

- **Goal Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your existing Wealthfolio goals through a searchable dropdown selector
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Calendar grid visualization where each dot represents a milestone towards your goal
- **Real-time Portfolio Sync**: Automatically calculates progress using your actual portfolio allocations and current valuations
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover or click on dots to see detailed milestone information including target amounts and status
- **Configurable Step Size**: Customize how much each calendar dot represents (editable when no goal is selected)
- **Privacy Support**: Respects your balance privacy settings to hide sensitive financial information
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Empty State Handling**: Graceful handling when no goals exist with helpful guidance to create your first goal

## How It Works

1. **Select a Goal**: Choose from your existing Wealthfolio goals using the searchable dropdown, or work without a goal for custom tracking
2. **View Real-time Progress**: The addon calculates your current progress using:
   - Your actual portfolio holdings and valuations
   - Goal allocations (when a goal is selected)
   - Account balances across all your investment accounts
3. **Interactive Calendar Display**:
   - âœ… **Filled dots** for completed milestones
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Partially filled dot** showing current progress within the milestone
   - âšª **Empty dots** for future milestones
   - ðŸ’¡ **Tooltips** with detailed information on hover/click
4. **Customize Settings**: Adjust step size to change what each dot represents (when no goal is selected)

- Create custom React hooks for complex data fetching and processing
- Build interactive UI components with tooltips and searchable dropdowns
- Handle loading states, error states, and empty states gracefully
- Integrate with the Wealthfolio sidebar navigation and routing system
