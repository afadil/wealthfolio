# Portfolio Equity & Loan Tracking Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished: Complete Backend Foundation**

We successfully built a comprehensive loan tracking system that separates actual portfolio equity from borrowed funds, providing transparent financial insights.

## 🔍 **Key Problem Solved**

**Original Issue**: User's "Net Deposit" dropped ~80%
**Root Cause**: The system was incorrectly mixing borrowed money with actual invested capital
**Solution**: Implemented 4-metric system to clearly separate equity from loans

## 📊 **The 4-Metric Financial System**

1. **Portfolio Equity** - What you'd have if you sold everything and repaid loans (Total Value - Outstanding Loans)
2. **Outstanding Loans** - Current balance of borrowed money (LOAN_TAKEN - LOAN_REPAID)  
3. **Total Value** - Portfolio value including borrowed money (existing behavior)
4. **Net Deposit** - Your actual money invested, excludes loans (existing behavior)
