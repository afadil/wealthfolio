# Portfolio Equity and Loan Tracking Enhancement

## Overview
Enhance the dashboard to show 4 different portfolio metrics with clear separation between actual equity and borrowed funds.

## Terminology
- **Portfolio Equity**: Total Value minus outstanding loans (what you'd have if you sold everything and repaid loans)
- **Outstanding Loans**: Current balance of borrowed money (LOAN_TAKEN - LOAN_REPAID)
- **Total Value**: Current behavior (includes loan money)
- **Net Deposit**: Current behavior (your actual money invested, excludes loans)

## UI Changes Required

### Dashboard Graph Enhancement
- [ ] **Default view (2 graphs shown)**:
  1. **Portfolio Equity** (primary line, positive values)
  2. **Outstanding Loans** (secondary line, negative values, different color/style)

- [ ] **Hover view (additional 2 graphs)**:
  3. **Total Value** (current behavior, includes loans)
  4. **Net Deposit** (current behavior, excludes loans)

### Graph Styling
- [ ] Portfolio Equity: Primary color (blue/green), solid line
- [ ] Outstanding Loans: Warning color (red/orange), dashed/dotted line, negative values
- [ ] Total Value: Secondary color (gray), shown on hover only
- [ ] Net Deposit: Tertiary color (purple), shown on hover only
- [ ] Add proper legend with toggle controls
- [ ] Update tooltips to show all 4 values clearly

## Backend/Data Changes Required

### New Calculations Needed
- [ ] **Calculate Outstanding Loan Balance**:
  - Sum all LOAN_TAKEN amounts
  - Subtract all LOAN_REPAID amounts
  - Track this over time for historical graphs

- [ ] **Calculate Portfolio Equity**:
  - Portfolio Equity = Total Value - Outstanding Loans
  - Ensure this is calculated for all historical dates

### Database Schema Evaluation
- [ ] **Option A**: Add loan tracking to existing `account_valuation` table
  - Add `outstanding_loans` column
  - Add `portfolio_equity` column

- [ ] **Option B**: Create separate loan tracking table
  - Track loan balances separately
  - Join with portfolio data for calculations

- [ ] **Option C**: Calculate on-the-fly from activities
  - No schema changes
  - Calculate loan balance from LOAN_TAKEN/LOAN_REPAID activities
  - May impact performance for large datasets

### Core Service Updates
- [ ] Update `portfolio/valuation/valuation_calculator.rs`:
  - Add loan balance calculation from activities
  - Add portfolio equity calculation
  - Ensure historical accuracy

- [ ] Update `portfolio/snapshot/holdings_calculator.rs`:
  - Track loan balance in snapshots
  - Include loan data in account state

- [ ] Update portfolio service APIs:
  - Include loan data in responses
  - Ensure frontend gets all 4 metrics

## Code Dependency Evaluation

### Critical Dependencies to Review
- [ ] **Performance Calculations**:
  - `src-core/src/portfolio/performance/` - Check if returns are calculated using Total Value
  - Verify that performance metrics should use Portfolio Equity instead
  - Update ROI, IRR, and other return calculations

- [ ] **Comparison Features**:
  - Account comparisons
  - Benchmark comparisons
  - Time period comparisons
  - Ensure consistency in which value is used

- [ ] **Export Functionality**:
  - CSV exports

  - Check which portfolio values are exported

- [ ] **Dashboard Components**:
  - Summary cards
  - Account overview
  - Holdings view
  - Income tracking

### Frontend Dependencies
- [ ] **Chart Components**:
  - `src/components/dashboard/` - Portfolio chart components
  - `src/components/portfolio/` - Portfolio-specific charts
  - Line chart configurations

- [ ] **Data Fetching**:
  - Portfolio hooks and queries
  - Account data fetching
  - Historical data loading

- [ ] **Display Components**:
  - Portfolio summary cards
  - Account balance displays
  - Performance indicators

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: Performance Calculations Use Total Value Instead of Portfolio Equity

**Problem**: The "Portfolio Performance" page still calculates performance using `total_value` (which includes loans) instead of `portfolio_equity` (actual equity).

**Root Cause**: The performance service in `src-core/src/portfolio/performance/performance_service.rs` uses `total_value` throughout all calculations:
- Line 167-168: Validation checks using `total_value`
- Line 175, 177: TWR calculations using `prev_total_value` and `current_total_value` 
- Line 223, 225: Gain/loss calculations using `start_point.total_value` and `end_point.total_value`
- Line 730+: Simple performance calculations using `current.total_value`

**Impact**: Users see inflated performance numbers that include borrowed money rather than their actual equity performance.

#### Additional Phase 3 Tasks - CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
5. [✅] **Update Performance Service to Use Portfolio Equity**
   - [✅] **Helper Method**: Added `get_performance_value()` to intelligently choose between `portfolio_equity` and `total_value`
   - [✅] **Primary Fix**: Modified `calculate_account_performance()` to use portfolio equity for all calculations
   - [✅] **Summary Fix**: Modified `calculate_account_performance_summary()` to use portfolio equity
   - [✅] **Simple Performance Fix**: Modified `calculate_simple_performance()` to use portfolio equity
   - [✅] **Validation Updates**: Updated negative value checks to use portfolio equity
   - [✅] **Currency Handling**: Updated currency conversion calculations to use portfolio equity

6. [✅] **Account-Specific Logic**
   - [✅] **Portfolio Total**: Always use `portfolio_equity` for portfolio total account (PORTFOLIO_TOTAL_ACCOUNT_ID)
   - [✅] **Individual Accounts**: Use `portfolio_equity` when loans exist (`outstanding_loans > 0`), fallback to `total_value` otherwise
   - [✅] **Backward Compatibility**: Smart fallback to `total_value` for accounts without loan data

7. [✅] **Performance Metrics Updates**
   - [✅] **TWR Calculations**: Updated Time-Weighted Return calculations to use portfolio equity
   - [✅] **MWR Calculations**: Updated Money-Weighted Return calculations to use portfolio equity  
   - [✅] **Gain/Loss**: Updated gain/loss amount calculations to use portfolio equity
   - [✅] **Portfolio Weights**: Updated portfolio weight calculations to use portfolio equity
   - [✅] **Volatility & Drawdown**: Volatility and max drawdown now use equity-based returns

**✅ CORE COMPILATION SUCCESS**: All changes compile successfully in src-core

8. [ ] **Testing & Validation** - READY FOR TESTING
   - [ ] **Test Portfolio Performance Page**: Verify it shows equity-based performance (not loan-inflated)
   - [ ] **Test Individual Account Performance**: Verify individual accounts work correctly  
   - [ ] **Test Accounts Without Loans**: Ensure no regression for loan-free accounts
   - [ ] **Test Historical Data**: Verify performance accuracy with historical loan data
   - [ ] **Full Tauri Compilation**: Verify entire project compiles with performance fixes
   - [ ] **Integration Test**: Run app and verify performance calculations are correct

### 🎯 **MAJOR PROGRESS COMPLETED**

**✅ Performance Calculation Engine Fixed**: 
- All backend performance calculations now use Portfolio Equity instead of Total Value
- Smart logic: Portfolio total always uses equity, individual accounts use equity when loans exist
- Time-Weighted Returns, Money-Weighted Returns, gain/loss, and volatility all fixed
- Backward compatibility maintained for accounts without loan data

**📊 Impact**: Portfolio Performance page will now show true investment performance excluding borrowed funds

**🚀 Next Steps**: Test the fixes by running the application and verifying the Portfolio Performance page shows correct equity-based performance metrics.
